{{! Handlebars comments look like this}}
<!--They won't be visible if the client inspects the html, unlike this comment-->

if you need to access the parent context object, use ../
    for example, in a foreach loop of book in books, if you needed to access the object which owns books
    inside the loop you would need ../ in handlebars

- layouts work well if your view fits within a single element of the layout overall
    - but what happens if view needs to inject into multiple different parts of the layout?
    - for example, adding something to both the body and head element
    - or, to insert a script that uses jquery (which is usually the last thing loaded)
    - you can use the concept of sections to make this work
