Certificate Authority include trusted root certs when you install the browser, extablishing the chain of trusted
When you stand up a new website, you can generate your own cert, but other browsers won't trust it because it isn't generated by a trusted can
If your website uses a certificate from a CA that's not known to the browser, the browser will warn you

Certs are issued by four CA companies
    - Go Daddy
    - Symntec
    Comodo
    globalSign

cost are 10 per year (reseller) to 300

- Typically, https terminates at a proxy server (since the proxy server and the app exist on the same trusted network)
- Cross site Request forgery: If you are signed into secure site (usaa) and then access a second site with malicious code, the session is still open
    - the malicious site will attempt to make a request from your browser and will be authenticated
    - defeated by using a csurf token unique to the session

- When you use a thirdparty login (ie, facebook), the server (ie meadowlark) serves redirects to facebook, which then redirects back to the client.  
    The client response is sent to facebook, NOT your site.  Facebook then redirects and auth message back to your site
