- Node does compile to machine code using google's V8 javascript compiler
    - this is done transparently, so there is no "compile" step.  it behaves like an interpreted language

- Node is built with backend databases in mind, but is especially built for working with JSON and NoSQL databases

- The Javascript stack:
    - Node is the platform that runs as a web server
    - Express is the web app framework 
    - templating engines allow you to combine code and markup
    - The database is typically a NoSQL document store like MongoDB
    - The clientside framework is something like angular or dojo
    
- in old web servers like apache, the web server just knows where a static file is and serves it on
    a request
    - a web app layer like Spring is what allows for complicated dispatching, data, etc.
    - with node the app is the web server - they aren't different
    
- Fundamental philosophy behind node is event driven programming, only instead of an event from a GUI
    you are responding to events from the server

- Routing: the mechanism by which a client is served the content it asked for
